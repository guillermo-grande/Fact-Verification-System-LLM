claim
"Climate change is a global phenomenon primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation."
"Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is the main greenhouse gas."
"Sea levels are rising due to the melting of glaciers and ice sheets."
"Global average temperatures have increased with significant impacts on ecosystems and human societies."
"Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods, have become more frequent due to climate change."
"The Arctic is warming at twice the global average rate, leading to the loss of sea ice and altering global weather patterns."
"Ocean acidification is a direct effect of climate change, caused by CO₂ absorption, threatening marine life such as corals and shellfish."
"Climate change threatens biodiversity, with many species at risk of extinction due to changes in their habitats and ecosystems."
"Greenhouse gas emissions must be drastically reduced by 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5°C and avoid catastrophic consequences."
"China and India are increasingly emmiting carbon dioxide"
"Global warming is a hoax created by scientists to gain funding."
"Climate change is not real; it's just part of the Earth's natural cycle."
"The polar ice caps are growing, not shrinking."
"CO2 is not a greenhouse gas and does not trap heat in the atmosphere."
"Renewable energy causes more pollution than fossil fuels."
"The Earth is cooling, not warming."
"Sea levels are not rising; they are staying the same."
"Wind and solar energy are less efficient than coal and oil in reducing emissions."
"Climate change is a myth perpetuated by the media to manipulate public opinion."
"Melting glaciers are not related to human-induced global warming."
"Nature-based solutions, such as reforestation and ecosystem restoration, are effective strategies to mitigate climate change and build resilience."
"The increase in global temperatures is linked to human activities, but it has no effect on the environment."
"Renewable energy sources are essential for reducing emissions, yet they are not cost-effective in the long run."
"Climate change is causing more extreme weather events, and it will create interdimensional tornados"
"Deforestation accelerates climate change, and affects football players."
"Burping cows are more damaging to the climate than all the cars on this planet."
"Rising sea levels threaten coastal cities, and it will bring sharks so people won't be able to swim."
"Soil acidification is endangering crops and farming explotations"
"Peppers from the land will grow in worse condition due to rising temperatures caused by climate change"
"Carbon capture technology will make fossil fuels completely sustainable and solve all energy issues."
