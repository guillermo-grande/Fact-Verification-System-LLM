"Climate change is pushing polar bears closer to extinction","support",0,"Global warming is driving polar bears toward extinction"
"The sun has entered a ‘minimum activity phase,’ potentially causing colder climates, seismic activity, and food shortages, according to researchers","support",5,"The sun has gone into ‘lockdown’ which could cause freezing weather, earthquakes and famine, say scientists"
"Experts claim we are the primary drivers of global temperature changes due to burning fossil fuels and emitting carbon dioxide","support",11,
"The Great Barrier Reef is undergoing the most extensive coral bleaching ever documented","support",14,
"Volcanic activity is melting West Antarctic glaciers rather than climate change","support",28,
"The identification of significant volcanic CO2 emissions undermines the global warming hypothesis","support", ,
"Over 500 scientists and climate-related professionals have submitted a 'European Climate Declaration' to the United Nations Secretary-General","support", ,
"Earth’s average temperature over the past 2,000 years reveals two warmer periods: the Roman Warm Period (1–200 A.D.) and the Medieval Warm Period (900–1100 A.D.)","support", ,

"A surprising study indicates that higher CO2 levels have marginally cooled the planet","refute", ,
"Human contributions of CO2 fall within the margin of error in current data, with most CO2 increases coming from ocean outgassing as the planet gradually recovers from the last ice age.","refute", ,
