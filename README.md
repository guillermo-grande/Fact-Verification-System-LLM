# Fact Verification System 
This project is a Fact Verification System leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)
and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks. The system validates factual claims
by combining advanced semantic understanding with dynamic, context-aware retrival of 
trusted information. 

## Setup & Dependency Management

To simplify setting up the project in the VM,  we could use `conda` (for quick environment manager) and `make` to automate the deployment. The following steps allows a quick setup. 

1. Install conda env. There are two methods: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download?utm_source=anacondadocs&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=download&utm_content=topnavalldocs) or the prefered [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#) (it is lightweight and quicker)
2. Create the environment with the required packages. It has an specified python version, you may change it
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
