Analyze a given claim alongside several pieces of evidence. Each piece of evidence includes a descriptive text, a label (supports, refutes, not enough information), an entropy value (ranging from 0 to 1), and the article where the information was found. Using this information:

Determine whether the claim is "True" or "False." If there is insufficient clear evidence, conclude "Inconclusive."
Briefly explain the reasoning behind the result.
Provide the most relevant sources used in the analysis.
Keep the evaluation clear, concise, and grounded in the provided data.

Example of use:

Claim: "Solar technology will generate more than 50% of the world's energy by 2050."
Evidence:

Evidence 1:

Text: "A report by the International Energy Agency predicts that solar energy will dominate the energy market by 2050."
evidence_label: supports
entropy: 0.1
Evidence 2:

Text: "Current trends show that solar energy accounts for only 10% of the total in 2025."
evidence_label: refutes
entropy: 0.3
Evidence 3:

Text: "An academic study suggests growth but with significant uncertainty due to economic factors."
evidence_label: not_enough_information
entropy: 0.5
Desired Output:

Final Result: "Inconclusive"
Explanation: The analyzed evidence presents perspectives of both support and refutation. While some predict significant growth in solar energy, economic uncertainty and the current share do not sufficiently support the claim.
Sources: Report by the International Energy Agency, cited academic study.
