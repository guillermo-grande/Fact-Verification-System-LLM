[atomic EXPLANATION]
* The evidence clearly indicates that climate change is impacting polar bears. Source 1 states that sea ice shrinkage has led to higher mortality rates in polar bear cubs and changes in denning locations for pregnant females. Additionally, Source 2 explains that rising temperatures cause earlier sea ice melt, which affects the bears' ability to build fat reserves necessary for survival during food-scarce periods. These sources collectively support the claim that climate change affects polar bears

CURRENT ATOMIC PARTS:

CONCLUSION: "SUPPORT"  
EXPLANATION: 
The evidence clearly indicates that polar bears face significant threats due to climate change, leading to malnutrition
and starvation from habitat loss [1]. Additionally, higher mortality rates in polar bear cubs have been linked to the 
effects of sea ice shrinkage [2]. These factors collectively support the claim that polar bears die as a consequence 
of these environmental changes.
